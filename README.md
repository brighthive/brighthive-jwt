# NAME OF APP
One sentence explanation of the tool.

## Motivation (Why did we build this?)
Why did Brighthive build this?

## Demo (or Features)
What does this tool do? Include screenshots and/or GIFs.

Alternatively, this section may enumerate the features of the app. Use bullet points.

## How to use [NAME OF APP]
[OPTIONAL] This section describes how to use the app, e.g., how to install it via `pip`, how to configure it, how to execute useful functions, etc. This section is necessary for libraries and scripts, but may not be useful for web APIs. 

## How to develop [NAME OF APP]
**Alternatively, you can call this section "Getting Started" â€“ the preferred header if you omit "How to use."** 

This section should provide instructions for running the app locally: requirements, docker, virtualenv management, etc. Future Brighthive developers need this section, in particular! But this section can also be beneficial to off-the-street open source developers. For this reason, please include the following text somewhere:

> We welcome code contributions, suggestions, and reports! Please report bugs and make suggestions using Github issues. The Brighthive team will triage and prioritize your issue as soon as possible.

### Formatting

To autopep8 format from terminal,

```shell
pipenv run format
```

## Testing
How do I run tests? (And what libraries did we use to write said tests?)
